People-centric Evolutionary System (PES)

PCES is a new machine learning system that combines the flexibility of genetic-based machine learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction, data visualisation, and human insights to learn competitive and interpretable predictive models and business rules. Different from conventional machine learning algorithms, PCES allows users (e.g. data scientists and researchers) to monitor the evolutionary/training process of their models and to interactively intervene and decide how models should be built.

PCES can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. It has been successfully used for a number of logistics and supply chain applications including production scheduling, two-dimensional strip packing, project scheduling, and resource-constraint job scheduling. In these applications, PCES can produce simple and reactive solutions which can outperform existing heuristics and optimisation methods in the literature. Other applications in financial trading, credit scoring, and computer vision can also be found in our examples.
